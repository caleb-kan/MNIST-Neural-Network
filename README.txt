This repository provides a comprehensive guide on how to train a neural network in Python using the Computer Vision library and the MNIST dataset. The ultimate goal of this project is to train a neural network capable of identifying handwritten single-digit integers.

A neural network is a type of machine learning model that is designed to mimic the human brain's pattern of learning from the data it is trained on. It consists of interconnected layers of nodes or "neurons" that carry forward information from the input data to produce an output. The strength of the connections between these neurons is determined by weights and biases, which are adjusted during the training process.

Neural networks learn from data by a process called training. During training, the network makes predictions on the input data and these predictions are compared to the actual values. The difference is quantified as an error, and the network adjusts its weights and biases to minimize this error in a process called backpropagation.

The Computer Vision library in Python provides tools and functions that make it easier to work with image data, making it particularly useful for tasks like ours. It can be used to preprocess the images in the MNIST dataset and make them suitable for input into our neural network.

The MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset is a large dataset of handwritten digits that has been commonly used for training various image processing systems. The dataset is made up of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, each of which is a 28x28 grayscale image of a handwritten digit.

Our neural network will be trained on the MNIST dataset. It will learn to identify the patterns in the grayscale pixel values of the handwritten digits. After successful training, the network will be able to take a new, unseen image of a handwritten digit and correctly identify the digit it represents.
